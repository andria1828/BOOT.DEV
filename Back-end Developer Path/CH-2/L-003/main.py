Storing Results
Now that we know how to store and change the value of variables let's do some math!

Here are some examples of common mathematical operators in Python syntax.

summation = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division

Parentheses can be used to order math operations.

avg = (a + b + c) / 3

Assignment
Create a new variable called armored_health on line 4 and set it equal to player_health * armor_multiplier
"""

player_health = 1000
armor_multiplier = 2

armored_health  = player_health * armor_multiplier
print(armored_health)
