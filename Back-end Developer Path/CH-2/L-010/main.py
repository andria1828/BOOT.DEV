NoneType Variables
Not all variables have a value. We can make an "empty" variable by setting it to None. None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is not the same as zero, False, or an empty string.

my_mental_acuity = None

The value of my_mental_acuity in this case is None until we use the assignment operator, =, to give it a value.

None Is NOT a String
NoneType is not the same as a string with a value of "None":

my_none = None # this is a None-type
my_none = "None" # this is a string with the value "None"

Assignment
Declare a variable named enemy and set it to None. Don't change the print() function
"""

# create the empty "enemy" variable here
enemy = None

# don't touch below this line
print(enemy is None)
