The Console
The "console" shows you the text output of your program. It's right beneath the code editor.

To see what's happening in our code, we need to print it to the console by using the print() function.

We'll learn more about functions later, but for now, just know that print() function will print anything you put inside its parentheses, like this:

print("Greetings, adventurer!")

Assignment
We need to greet our new players! Print the following text to the console:

Greetings, adventurer!
"""
print("Greetings, adventurer!")
