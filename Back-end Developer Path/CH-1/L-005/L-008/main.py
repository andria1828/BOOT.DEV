Syntax Errors
"Syntax" is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand". For example, the following code has invalid syntax:

print("hello world')

It has mismatched quotes around the string hello world. One is a single quote ' and the other is a double quote ".

Assignment
Let's continue our work on Fantasy Quest. There's a bug in our game, and our players are distraught.

They're so needy... it's not like we added microtransactions...

The code was supposed to print Welcome to Fantasy Quest! to our users, but they get an error instead. Find the syntax error in the code editor, and fix it.
"""

print("Welcome to Fantasy Quest!")
