What Is “Code”?
Code is just a series of instructions for a computer to follow one after another. Programs can have a lot of instructions.

The Boot.dev backend has 46,119 lines of code as I write this... and it's much smaller than some other projects I've worked on.

Remember how we used the print() instruction to print text to the console? We can also use it to print numbers. This prints the number 42:

print(42)

Well, addition is one of the most common instructions in programming. This also prints the number 42:

print(40 + 2)

It first calculates the sum inside the parentheses, and then prints the result.

Assignment
Simple addition is used all the time in game development. In Fantasy Quest, we want weapons to deal bonus damage when they're enchanted.

Our hero's sword deals 250 damage normally, but should deal an additional 75 damage when it's enchanted.

Calculate and print the result of 250 + 75

print(250 + 75)
