Lesson Failure
You've probably noticed that you have a Submit and a Run button.

Run: For testing and debugging. There is no penalty for running your code.
Submit: Runs your code, but also checks its output against our answer key. If the output doesn't match, you'll be punished.
Pro tip: You wouldn't deploy code to end users without testing... right? So don't submit code without running it first! The goal of this game mechanic is to encourage good real-world coding practices. "Submit" is like deploying to production.

What's the Penalty?
When you fail a lesson, one of two things will happen:

If you have armor, you'll lose one. That armor is consumed to protect you from future failures on that lesson.
If you don't have an armor, you'll lose your sharpshooter spree, and it will reset to zero. Each time your spree counter hits 15, you'll earn a random chest. Chests contain gems and items (like armor).
Assignment
