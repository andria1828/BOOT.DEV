Syntax Errors Quiz
Syntax: The rules for how expressions and statements should be structured in a language. For example, in Python, the following is correct syntax:

print("hello world")

While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

fmt.Println("hello world")

Syntax errors aren't the only kind of problems you can run into when coding, for example:

A bug in your logic. Your code is valid, and will run, but it does something unexpected.
It's too slow. Your code is valid and does what's expected, but it does it slowly.
In this course, we're just concerned with syntax and logic errors. We'll cover performance issues in a later course.
